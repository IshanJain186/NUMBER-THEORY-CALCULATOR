*Problem Statement

Performing common number theory operations manually can be time-consuming, error-prone, and inconvenient for students and beginners. Tasks such as finding the GCD, generating prime numbers,
checking Armstrong or palindrome numbers, and producing Fibonacci sequences require repeated calculations. A simple tool is needed to perform these operations quickly and accurately.

*Scope of the Project

This project provides a lightweight Python-based calculator that performs essential number theory computations. It focuses on educational use and small-scale mathematical tasks. 
The tool covers only foundational algorithms and is intended for learning, practice, and quick evaluations rather than advanced or large-scale mathematical computation.

*Target Users

Students learning Python or basic number theory

Beginners practicing algorithms and mathematical logic

Teachers demonstrating simple computational methods

Anyone needing quick number-theory-related checks or calculations

*High-Level Features

Compute GCD of two numbers

Generate all prime numbers up to a given value

Prime factorization of an integer

Armstrong number checker

Palindrome number checker

Fibonacci series generator

This project emphasizes simplicity, readability, and educational value.
